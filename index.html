    <p>I am very excited for my new path down Software Development. Its something that you never stop learning and growing in, which is not something ive always had in my past work experinces. I also have a passion for video games and how they work. Something i've always been a big fan of is creating something out of nothing and thats exactly what i strive to do with my future career as a Software Developer.  </p>
